## Design
My goal was to create a website to feel like the bakery and show how they are related. I also want visitors to easily understand what the website is for and what it's all about.

## Wireframes
* I used Figma to design wireframes, which helped me to create a visual representation of the website's appearance.
* The website was completed with only minor differences from the original plan, although a few parts were exluded from the footer and some styling including the Instagram feed and form.

## Colours
I got inspiration from the specific color palette below but modified it to match Julie's Bakery's branding.

## Typography
Using Playfair Display for headings and Didact Gothic for body text results in a modern and seamless design that connects with the Julie's bakery's logo and brand, while also making the text easy to read and understand.

## Logo
The bakery's logo, which features a simple text and a lemon symbol, was personally designed by me.

# Technologies Used

* [HTML](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) 
* [CSS](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [JavaScript](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript)

# Testing

I tested all the links on every page, and they're working as expected. The navigation bar was also tested on different devices and works fine. Additionally, I checked the website's appearance on various screen sizes, and everything seems to be working correctly.

### List of main issues:

#### The toggle menu fails to remain hidden off-screen, even when it is supposed to be hidden.
* The solution involved updating the JavaScript code to set the display property to "block" and "none", and also adding the CSS styling display: none; to the "nav-links" class.

#### The image in the flexbox was leaving a small space at the bottom. 
* The solution was to add the following CSS property: { display: block; }.

#### The logo was appearing pixelated and unclear.
* The solution was to use SVG file for the logo instead of PNG.

#### Issues using "required" attribute on the checkbox input.
* The solution was to remove the "required" attribute and use JavaScript to ensure that at least one checkbox is selected before the form can be submitted.

## Validator Testing

#### HTML

* The [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML code. Some adjustments were made, including removing extra close tags, erasing the ARIA label on Font Awesome icons, and correcting the misuse of ARIA label for the toggle menu.

#### CSS
* The CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), which indicated that quotes needed to be added to the font name that contains white space.

#### Accessibility (Devtool Lighthouse Report)
* I ran a Lighthouse test on the website and it received a high score, except for the "Best Practices" section. The reason for this is due to the Instagram widget, which displays images in the wrong format.
